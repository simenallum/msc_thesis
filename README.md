# Camera-based perception system for autonomous drones in search and rescue missions at sea

Implementation of my master's thesis in cybernetics and robotics at NTNU. The goal of the project is to make a camera-based perception system for an autonomous drone. The system is indended to be used together with a mission planner for autonomous drones in search and rescue missions at sea.

In addition to the code in this repository, the [YOLOv8](https://github.com/simenallum/yolov8_ros) nodes and [ROS Olympe bridge](https://github.com/simenallum/ros_olympe) are needed in order to run the full system.
