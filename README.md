# Camera-Based Perception System for Autonomous Drones in Search-and-Rescue Missions at Sea

Implementation of my master's thesis in Cybernetics and Robotics at NTNU. The goal of the project is to make a camera-based perception system for an autonomous drone. The system is indended to be used together with a mission planner for autonomous drones in search-and-rescue missions at sea.

In addition to the code in this repository, the [YOLOv8](https://github.com/simenallum/yolov8_ros) nodes and [ROS Olympe bridge](https://github.com/simenallum/ros_olympe) are needed in order to run the full system.
